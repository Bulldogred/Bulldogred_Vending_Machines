# Vending Machines

This is a custom FiveM resource designed for use with the **QBCore** or **QBOX** framework.  
It provides **fully working vending machines**, supporting snacks, drinks, animations, and item usage.

I decided to make this resource free because there aren‚Äôt any good working vending machine scripts out there ‚Äî so now there is.
